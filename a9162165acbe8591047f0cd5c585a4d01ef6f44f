TODO: Remove vendor/serde/ directory

Once the serde library is properly available via mops or another
package manager, remove the typecheck-only stub at vendor/serde/.

The stub was a temporary solution for typechecking during development.
Production code should use the real mo:serde implementation.

TODO: Re-add Motoko generated samples to git

Currently in .gitignore per policy "not ready for commit yet".
When the Motoko generator is stable and production-ready:

1. Remove motoko/ entries from .gitignore
2. git add samples/client/petstore/motoko*
3. Commit as reference implementations

Keep samples in sync with template changes going forward.
