TODO: Remove vendor/serde/ directory

Once the serde library is properly available via mops or another
package manager, remove the typecheck-only stub at vendor/serde/.

The stub was a temporary solution for typechecking during development.
Production code should use the real mo:serde implementation.

DONE: Re-add Motoko generated samples to git

✅ Completed in commit 29e2dda01ec
- Removed motoko/ entries from .gitignore
- Added samples/client/petstore/motoko* to git
- Committed as reference implementations

Going forward: Keep samples in sync with template changes.

TODO: Create integration tests for Motoko generator

Add automated tests that:
- Generate Motoko samples from various OpenAPI specs
- Typecheck generated code with moc
- Verify correct handling of edge cases (arrays, maps, optional fields)
- Test both useDfx=true and useDfx=false modes

Consider adding to CI pipeline.

TODO: Document Motoko generator in upstream OpenAPITools

Prepare PR for OpenAPITools/openapi-generator documentation:
- Add Motoko to list of supported generators
- Document configuration options (useDfx, projectName)
- Include example usage and generated code samples
- Link to IC/Motoko resources

Target: docs/generators/motoko.md

TODO: Test with real-world OpenAPI specs

Beyond petstore, test generator with:
- GitHub API (complex nested objects)
- Stripe API (extensive use of discriminators)
- OpenAI API (large enum types)
- Internet Computer API specs (if available)

Identify and fix edge cases in production APIs.
