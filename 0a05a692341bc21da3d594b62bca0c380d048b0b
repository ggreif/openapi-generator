TODO: Add end-to-end test for Map name collision

Test case: OpenAPI spec with a user-defined model named "Map"

The Motoko generator needs to handle conflicts between:
- User-defined models (e.g., a model called "Map")
- Core library types (Map<K,V> from mo:core/pure/Map)

Test should verify:
1. User-defined "Map" model gets escaped (e.g., "Map_")
2. Map<K,V> parameterized type still works correctly
3. Both can coexist in generated code without conflicts

Similar pattern to other reserved words like "Text", "Error", etc.
