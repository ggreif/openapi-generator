TODO: Improve handling of empty HTTP 200 responses

Test 10 (testGetStatus200) currently returns:
"ERROR: Expected 200 but got error - HTTP 200: Failed to parse JSON"

This happens because httpbin.org's /status/200 endpoint returns an empty
body (content-length: 0), which cannot be parsed as JSON.

Current behavior:
- Generator expects all 200 responses to have JSON body (based on OpenAPI spec)
- Empty body causes "Failed to parse JSON: Failed to parse JSON text" error
- Error handling correctly identifies it as HTTP 200 with unparseable content

Possible improvements:
1. Handle empty response bodies gracefully (return empty object or null)
2. Check Content-Length header before attempting JSON parse
3. Make JSON parsing optional based on Content-Type header
4. Update OpenAPI spec to indicate no response body for /status/200

Current workaround:
- Use endpoints that return actual JSON bodies for 200 tests
- Or accept that the test shows correct error handling for malformed 200 responses

Priority: Low (test still validates error messages include correct status codes)
