TODO: Fix Motoko generator bugs found during Yamaha API testing

Three critical generator bugs discovered:

1. oneOf handling bug: Generator creates empty record {} instead of proper variant types for oneOf parameters. Example: SetVolumeVolumeParameter should be {#integer : Nat; #up; #down} but was generated as {}.

2. Inline enum bug: Parameters with inline enum definitions get typed as Text but code generates variant pattern switches, causing 'variant pattern cannot consume expected type Text' errors. Example: ZoneApi.mo:227 input parameter.

3. Similar issue in PowerApi with variant patterns on Text parameters.

See samples/client/yamaha-musiccast/motoko-test/GENERATOR_BUGS.md for full details.

Needs fixes in MotokoClientCodegen.java for proper inline enum and oneOf support.
