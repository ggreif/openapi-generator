TODO: Switch from ggreif/serde fork to official NatLabs/serde

The ggreif/serde fork is only used temporarily during the motoko-core transition.
Once the upstream serde repository has updated its mops.toml to use the published
core package (instead of local paths), switch back to the official repo.

Changes needed:
1. Update mops.toml template in /generate skill to use official serde
2. Use either published version: serde = "3.4.0" (or latest)
3. Or GitHub reference: serde = "https://github.com/NatLabs/serde#<commit>"
4. Verify all transitive dependencies resolve correctly with mops

This ensures generated samples use the canonical serde implementation.
