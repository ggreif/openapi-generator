TODO: Update mops.toml.mustache to use official published packages

When the motoko-core transition is complete and changes are upstreamed, update
the mops.toml.mustache template to use official published versions instead of
ggreif forks:

Changes needed in mops.toml.mustache:
1. Replace serde fork with official: serde = "3.4.0" (or latest)
   - Or use: serde = "https://github.com/NatLabs/serde#<commit>"
2. Replace byte-utils fork with official: byte-utils = "0.1.2" (or latest)
3. Remove or update the NOTE comment once forks are no longer needed
4. Verify all transitive dependencies still resolve correctly with mops

This ensures generated samples use canonical, maintained package versions.
