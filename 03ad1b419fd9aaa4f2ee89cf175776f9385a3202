TODO: Handle nested container types in Motoko generator

The Motoko generator currently has a limitation with nested container types:
- array-in-array: [[Int]]
- array-in-map: Map<Text, [Int]>
- map-in-array: [Map<Text, Int>]
- array-in-record: { items: [[Post]] }
- map-in-record: { metadata: Map<Text, [String]> }
- And reversed cases

Current code in MotokoClientCodegen.java line 210 has a TODO:
  parameter.dataType = "[" + parameter.items.dataType + "]"; // TODO: what if parameter.items.dataType is itself a collection?

This needs recursive handling to properly construct nested types. For example:
- [[Int]] should be generated as [[Int]], not [[array]]
- Map<Text, [Int]> should have proper type resolution
- Nested types in model properties need similar handling

Test these corner cases with OpenAPI specs that include:
- Array of arrays
- Maps with array values
- Arrays of maps
- Records/objects with nested container fields

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES FOUND:

1. **GeoJSON Specification (RFC 7946)** - PRIMARY EXAMPLE
   - Most common use case for nested arrays in OpenAPI specs
   - Has been driving nested array support since 2014

   Examples:
   - LineString coordinates: [[lon, lat, alt]] = array[array[number]]
   - Polygon rings: [[[lon, lat]]] = array[array[array[number]]]
   - MultiPolygon: [[[[lon, lat]]]] = array[array[array[array[number]]]]

   Working OpenAPI definitions available at:

   - https://gist.github.com/zit0un/3ac0575eb0f3aabdc645c3faad47ab4a

   Schema pattern for nested arrays:
   type: array
   items:
     type: array
     items:
       type: array
       items:
         type: number

2. **Stripe OpenAPI Spec** (github.com/stripe/openapi)
   - Uses objects containing arrays (e.g., list responses with data arrays)
   - Has arrays of complex objects with nested array fields
   - Does NOT use direct array-of-arrays patterns
   - Uses objects as intermediaries between array levels

3. **Kubernetes API Spec**
   - Explicitly restricts nested structures
   - x-kubernetes-list-map-keys states: "no nesting supported"
   - Uses flatter structures to avoid deep nesting

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:
- Nested arrays work in REQUEST/RESPONSE BODIES
- Nested arrays DON'T work in QUERY PARAMETERS (no serialization rules)
- OpenAPI 3.0+ supports nested arrays in schemas via repeated type:array + items

TESTING RECOMMENDATION:
Use a GeoJSON OpenAPI spec as the test case for nested container support.
It's the most widely used real-world example and would validate:
- Double nesting: LineString [[number]]
- Triple nesting: MultiPolygon [[[number]]]
- Arrays within objects (Feature with geometry.coordinates)
