TODO: Test Yamaha MusicCast API with home sound equipment

Test the generated Motoko client against actual Yamaha MusicCast-compatible
devices at home to verify:

- Real-world API compatibility
- Generated client functionality with actual hardware
- Zone control, transport controls, tuner operations
- Network/USB playback features
- Power management commands
- Error handling with real device responses

This will validate the generated code works with production hardware and
identify any edge cases or API quirks not captured in the OpenAPI spec.

Test environment:
- Home Yamaha sound equipment (MusicCast-compatible devices)
- IC canister deployment (or local dfx for testing)
- Real network environment with device discovery

Expected outcomes:
- Verify all generated API methods work correctly
- Document any spec vs. implementation differences
- Create integration test examples from real usage
