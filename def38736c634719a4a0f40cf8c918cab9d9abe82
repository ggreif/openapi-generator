TODO: Improve OpenAPI "type": "object" → Motoko type mapping

Current behavior:
- OpenAPI schema { "type": "object" } maps to Motoko type `Any`
- `Any` is an inferior type with limited capabilities:
  - Cannot use debug_show() on Any values
  - Cannot pattern match or inspect structure
  - Essentially opaque without further type information

Problem:
- Generic object schemas are common in OpenAPI specs for:
  - Flexible response bodies
  - Extension points
  - Dynamic content
- Mapping to `Any` makes these values difficult to work with

Possible improvements:
1. Generate a proper record type with optional fields for known properties
2. Use a more structured type like Map<Text, Variant> for dynamic objects
3. Provide utility functions to inspect/convert Any values
4. Warn in generated comments when Any is used
5. Allow custom type mappings via generator config

Example affected endpoints:
- /status/500, /status/503 response 200 (should never happen scenarios)
- Any endpoint with generic { "type": "object" } without properties

Priority: Medium (affects developer experience with dynamic APIs)
Related: This commit changes /status/200 → /json to avoid this issue
