# Yamaha MusicCast HTTP API

Yamaha MusicCast HTTP simplified API for Control Systems. This API provides comprehensive control and interrogation of MusicCast devices.  Prerequisites: - MusicCast devices must be on a fixed or bound IP Address - Device should be set to wired or wireless only (not both) to avoid network loops  Note: This specification covers the v1 simplified API. For more advanced functionality, see the v2 and extended APIs documented at: https://github.com/rsc-dev/pyamaha/tree/master/doc

### HTTP Outcalls and Cycles

The generated API client makes HTTP outcalls using the Internet Computer's management canister. HTTP outcalls require cycles to execute.

**Important:** Before calling any API endpoints, ensure your canister has sufficient cycles:

For local development:
```bash
# Get your canister ID
CANISTER_ID=$(dfx canister id your_canister_name)

# Add cycles (100 trillion cycles for testing)
dfx ledger fabricate-cycles --canister "$CANISTER_ID" --amount 100000000000000
```

For production deployment, you'll need to fund your canister with cycles through the NNS or cycles wallet.

Each HTTP outcall typically costs around 20-50 million cycles depending on the request/response size.
