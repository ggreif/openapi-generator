### HTTP Outcalls and Cycles

The generated API client makes HTTP outcalls using the Internet Computer's management canister. HTTP outcalls require cycles to execute.

**Important:** Before calling any API endpoints, ensure your canister has sufficient cycles:

For local development:
```bash
# Get your canister ID
CANISTER_ID=$(dfx canister id your_canister_name)

# Add cycles (100 trillion cycles for testing)
dfx ledger fabricate-cycles --canister "$CANISTER_ID" --amount 100000000000000
```

For production deployment, you'll need to fund your canister with cycles through the NNS or cycles wallet.

Each HTTP outcall typically costs around 20-50 million cycles depending on the request/response size.
