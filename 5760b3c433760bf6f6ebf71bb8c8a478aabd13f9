RESOLVED: Nested container types now verified working

The TODO at MotokoClientCodegen.java line 210 has been removed. Testing confirms:
- Nested arrays work correctly in responses, request bodies, and model properties
- Recursion is handled properly via getTypeDeclaration() method (called earlier in pipeline)
- Similar pattern to Swift generator implementation
- Test case: samples/client/nested-arrays/motoko-test/

Verified with:
- [[Int]] in response types ✓
- [[Int]] in request body parameters ✓
- [[Int]] in model properties ✓
- All code typechecks with moc ✓

The parameter.items.dataType is already recursively constructed by the time
postProcessParameter() is called, so no additional recursion needed there.
